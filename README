HedgehogHD
==========

An attempt to reimplment the famous YU2 Sonic platformer engine from the Sega Genesis.

Importer
--------

The only existing component currently is the importer facility, which
is a Python program that reads game geometry from the "Split
Disassembly" provided by the good folks at Sonic Retro.  This can be
acquired with:
    svn co https://sonicretro.org/asm_svn

To produce collision geometry SVG from Sonic 2, run from the root of the HedgehogHD repo:

    hedgehoghd/importer/hedgehoghd_import.py ~/path/to/sonic/retro/split/disassembly ~/svg_output/

To produce HTML documentation:

    cd doc
    make html
